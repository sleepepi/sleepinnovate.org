<%= @event.time_ago %>, you joined our innovative sleep research project. Thank you
for being part of SleepINNOVATE! Sleep is different for everyone. Your valuable
input will help researchers learn more about how sleep affects the health of
people like you. We hope that future research will help doctors determine the
best treatment for each patient.

Now we ask that you complete another set of brief survey questions and brain
quizzes whenever it's convenient for you. These activities will take about
15-20 minutes for the surveys and 10-15 minutes for the brain quizzes. You do
not need to complete all the activities in one sitting. Please follow the link
below to login and complete your surveys and brain quizzes.
