  What will happen in this research study?

  Description of the study activity:

%p
  We will ask you to complete surveys about yourself and your health, general
  functioning and sleep habits. The surveys will ask about such things as
  whether and when you were diagnosed with a sleep disorder, treatments you have
  used, medical illnesses such as high blood pressure, and your energy level.
  The health surveys will take less than 30 minutes to complete for most people.
  In addition, we will ask you to take a 20 minute brain quiz to help us
  understand the relationship between sleep and brain functions. This quiz will
  ask you to pay attention to words or pictures on your computer screen and make
  responses using the keyboard and mouse. The brain quizzes are administered by
  a non-profit organization called The Many Brains Project (testmybrain.org).
  This nonprofit organization works with researchers and educators to create
  testing tools for research studies. The Many Brains Project will have access
  to the testing results but no other information that could identify you.

%p
  Periodically, we will ask you to log onto the
  = render "layouts/logo"
  study website and complete a 15 minute health survey and another 20 minute
  brain quiz. We will ask you to do this approximately 3 months and every 6 to
  12 months.

%p
  In addition, we are asking you to give us permission to access to your health
  information and save this information to a research database. The types of
  information we would like to collect are:

%ul
  %li
    Your sleep study data (summary sleep reports, the waveforms collected on the
    sleep study, CPAP adherence data) (if you have had a sleep study or use CPAP
    type devices).

  %li
    Your Partners Health electronic medical records. We would like to extract
    information on your health conditions, treatments, health behaviors,
    hospitalizations, and procedures, and laboratory results.

  %li
    We may contact you in the future to get additional information and ask if
    you are interested in joining other research studies.

%p
  After accessing this information, we would remove "identifying information"
  such as name and date of birth, and extract relevant information related to
  sleep conditions.

%p
  After removing of all identifying information (name, date of birth, medical
  record numbers, dates of procedures, etc) we would like you to give us
  permission to have your sleep and health information deposited in a research
  repository so they can be analyzed by other researchers.

%p
  After you decide to sign up for the
  = render "layouts/logo"
  study, we will also ask you to enroll into the Partners Biobank if you have
  not already enrolled, or declined to enroll. We understand you may have been
  asked to take part in the Partners Biobank in the past. We would like to
  review this study with you again, and if you wish to take part, we will review
  a separate consent form with you.

%p
  The researchers will benefit from having these health data over many years to
  see how health changes over time. Information collected about you will be
  combined with information from other people who have joined the research
  study. When combining this information, your name and other personal
  information will not be used.

%h3
  We will send you reminder emails:

%p
  After you consent to the
  = render "layouts/logo"
  study, you will create an ID and password so that you can access your account
  in the study website. During the time you are enrolled in the study, we will
  contact you by email when there is a new survey or brain quiz that we want you
  to complete or consider. We plan to update your health status at period
  intervals such as after 3 months, 6 months, one year and approximately every
  year thereafter.

%p
  These reminder emails will not be encrypted. However, we will never send your
  personal information in an email. We will only send you a link to the
  = render "layouts/logo"
  study website for you to sign in with your ID and password. The reminder
  emails will be sent to the email address that you give us.
