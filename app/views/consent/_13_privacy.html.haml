  If I take part in this research study, how will you protect my privacy?

%p
  During this research, identifiable information about your health will be
  collected. In the rest of this section, we refer to this information simply as
  "health information." In general, under federal law, health information is
  private. However, there are exceptions to this rule, and you should know who
  may be able to see, use, and share your health information for research and
  why they may need to do so.

  In this study, we may collect health information about you from:

%ul
  %li
    Past, present, and future medical records
  %li
    Research procedures, including research office visits, tests, interviews,
    and questionnaires

  Who may see, use, and share your identifiable health information and why they
  may need to do so:

%ul
  %li
    Partners research staff involved in this study
  %li
    The sponsor(s) of this study, and the people or groups it hires to help

    that could mean harm to you or others, we may need to report this, as
    required by law)

%p
  Some people or groups who get your health information might not have to follow
  the same privacy rules that we follow and might use or share your health
  information without your permission in ways that are not described in this
  form. For example, we understand that the sponsor of this study may use your
  health information to perform additional research on various products or
  conditions, to obtain regulatory approval of its products, to propose new
  products, and to oversee and improve its products' performance. We share your
  health information only when we must, and we ask anyone who receives it from
  us to take measures to protect your privacy. The sponsor has agreed that it
  will not contact you without your permission and will not use or share your
  information for any mailing or marketing list. However, once your information
  is shared outside Partners, we cannot control all the ways that others use or
  share it and cannot promise that it will remain private.

%p
  Because research is an ongoing process, we cannot give you an exact date when
  we will either destroy or stop using or sharing your health information.

%p
  The results of this research study may be published in a medical book or
  journal, or used to teach others. However, your name or other identifying
  information
  %strong will not
  be used for these purposes without your specific permission.
