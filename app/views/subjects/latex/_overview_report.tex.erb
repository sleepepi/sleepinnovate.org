\textit{Once you complete all the surveys, you will receive a personal sleep
health report that you can print and bring to your doctor. The scores are based
on commonly used measures. Regardless of your scores, you should discuss any
sleep health concerns with your doctor.} \\ \\

<% @promis_disturbance = @subject.report_promis_disturbance(@data) %>

The Sleep Quality Assessment asked you how well you slept and how well-rested
you felt during the past seven days. A score greater than 55 suggest problems
with sleep quality. You can follow your score over time- if it decreases, this
suggests improvement. \\ \\

The Sleep Quality Assessment asked you how alert, sleepy or tired you are,
and how this impacted your daily activities during the past seven days. A
score greater than 55 suggest problems with sleep quality. You can follow
your score over time- if it decreases, this suggests improvement. \\ \\

The Horne-Ostberg Morningness-eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) evaluates
whether you are likely to be a lark (a morning person) or an owl
(an evening person). Low scores indicate evening types (scores less than
30), and high scores indicate morning types (score of greater than 30). \\ \\

<% @wpai_work = @subject.report_wpai_overall_work_impairment(@data) %>
\begin{Large}\textbf{WPAI:GH}\end{Large} (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment) \hfill
<% if @wpai_work %>\begin{Large}\textbf{<%= latex_safe format("%0.1f", @wpai_work) %>}\end{Large}<% else %>\textit{Complete surveys at SleepINNOVATE.org to get your score.}<% end %> \\

The scale measures the effect of your health problems on your ability to
work and perform regular activities. Higher scores indicate more
difficulty with work and/or productivity. \\ \\


<% @well_being_pcornet = @subject.report_well_being_pcornet(@data) %>
\begin{Large}\textbf{Well-Being Questions}\end{Large} (PCORNET) \hfill
<% if @well_being_pcornet %>\begin{Large}\textbf{<%= latex_safe @well_being_pcornet %>}\end{Large}<% else %>\textit{Complete surveys at SleepINNOVATE.org to get your score.}<% end %> \\

These questions measure your mood and your ability to think. They are scored on
a 1-5 scale with 1 being the best score (indicating a high level of well-being). \\ \\


<% @bmi = @subject.report_bmi(@data) %>
\begin{Large}\textbf{BMI}\end{Large} (Body mass index) \hfill
<% if @bmi %>\begin{Large}\textbf{<%= latex_safe format("%0.1f", @bmi) %>}\end{Large}<% else %>\textit{Complete surveys at SleepINNOVATE.org to get your score.}<% end %> \\

BMI is calculated based on your height and weight. \\
A BMI over 25 puts you in the 'overweight' category. Research has shown that people in this category are more likely to develop severe obstructive sleep apnea. \\ \\
