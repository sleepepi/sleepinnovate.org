% Section 1
\section*{About this consent form}

Please read this form carefully. It tells you important information about a
research study. A member of our research team will also talk to you about taking
part in this research study. People who agree to take part in research studies
are called ``subjects.'' This term will be used throughout this consent form. \\

Partners HealthCare System is made up of Partners hospitals, health care
providers, and researchers. In the rest of this consent form, we refer to the
Partners system simply as ``Partners.'' \\

If you have any questions about the research or about this form, please ask us.
Taking part in this research study is up to you. If you decide to take part in
this research study, you must sign this form to show that you want to take part.
We will give you a signed copy of this form to keep. \\

% Section 2
\section*{Why is this research study being done?}

The SleepINNOVATE study is paid for by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The study is led
by Dr. Susan Redline from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA. She and
her staff are available to answer any questions you may have. Please email
support@sleepinnovate.org with any questions or call 617-732-5859. \\

The purpose of the SleepINNOVATE study is to engage people with sleep disorders
to share health information needed for research that will improve the health and
well-being of adults with sleep disorders. \\

We hope to enroll at least 2,000 people into the SleepINNOVATE study. We are
asking you to take part in this research study because you have had a sleep
study, are scheduled to have a sleep study, or have a diagnosis of a sleep
disorder. You need to be 18 or older and have access to a computer or mobile
device (smart phone) and read English to participate in this study. \\


% Section 3
\section*{How long will I take part in this research study?}

We would like to keep track of your health status for at least 2 years, so we
know how your health changes over time. Keeping in touch with you and checking
on your health over many years is very important to help us look at the
long-term effects of sleep disorders and treatments on health. We plan to do
this by contacting you at least 1 to 3 times a year by email. \\


% Section 4
\section*{What will happen in this research study?}

\subsection*{Description of the study activity:}

We will ask you to complete surveys about yourself and your health, general
functioning and sleep habits. The surveys will ask about such things as
whether and when you were diagnosed with a sleep disorder, treatments you have
used, medical illnesses such as high blood pressure, and your energy level.
The health surveys will take less than 30 minutes to complete for most people.
In addition, we will ask you to take a 20 minute brain quiz to help us
understand the relationship between sleep and brain functions. This quiz will
ask you to pay attention to words or pictures on your computer screen and make
responses using the keyboard and mouse. The brain quizzes are administered by a
non-profit organization called The Many Brains Project (testmybrain.org). This
nonprofit organization works with researchers and educators to create testing
tools for research studies. The Many Brains Project will have access to the
testing results but no other information that could identify you.\\

Periodically, we will ask you to log onto the SleepINNOVATE study website and
complete a 15 minute health survey and another 20 minute brain quiz. We will
ask you to do this approximately 3 months and every 6 to 12 months. \\

In addition, we are asking you to give us permission to access to your health
information and save this information to a research database. The types of
information we would like to collect are: \\

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Your sleep study data (summary sleep reports, the waveforms collected on the
    sleep study, CPAP adherence data) (if you have had a sleep study or use CPAP
    type devices).
  \item
    Your Partners Health electronic medical records. We would like to extract
    information on your health conditions, treatments, health behaviors,
    hospitalizations, and procedures, and laboratory results.
  \item
    We may contact you in the future to get additional information and ask if
    you are interested in joining other research studies.
\end{itemize}

After accessing this information, we would remove "identifying information"
such as name and date of birth, and extract relevant information related to
sleep conditions. \\

After removing of all identifying information (name, date of birth, medical
record numbers, dates of procedures, etc) we would like you to give us
permission to have your sleep and health information deposited in a research
repository so they can be analyzed by other researchers. \\

After you decide to sign up for the SleepINNOVATE study, we will also ask you to
enroll into the Partners Biobank if you have not already enrolled, or declined
to enroll. We understand you may have been asked to take part in the Partners
Biobank in the past. We would like to review this study with you again, and if
you wish to take part, we will review a separate consent form with you. \\

The researchers will benefit from having these health data over many years to
see how health changes over time. Information collected about you will be
combined with information from other people who have joined the research
study. When combining this information, your name and other personal
information will not be used. \\

\subsection*{We will send you reminder emails:}

After you consent to the SleepINNOVATE study, you will create an ID and password
so that you can access your account in the study website. During the time you
are enrolled in the study, we will contact you by email when there is a new
survey or brain quiz that we want you to complete or consider. We plan to update
your health status at period intervals such as after 3 months, 6 months, one
year and approximately every year thereafter. \\

These reminder emails will not be encrypted. However, we will never send your
personal information in an email. We will only send you a link to the
SleepINNOVATE study website for you to sign in with your ID and password. The
reminder emails will be sent to the email address that you give us.

% Section 5
\section*{What are the risks and possible discomforts from being in this research study?}

Although we will do our best to protect your study information, there is
still a very small risk of loss of privacy. All study staff will be trained
and certified in the ethical conduct of human subject research and how to keep
all study information strictly confidential. \\

We do not expect there to be any risks to you from taking the surveys or brain
quizzes. For questions that might make you feel uncomfortable, you have the
option to skip that question or decline to respond. You are also free to end
the survey or brain quiz at any time. \\

% Section 6

\section*{What are the possible benefits from being in this research study?}

You will not obtain any direct health benefits from participating in the
study. We will give you feedback on how you did when you finish some of the
surveys and when you finish the brain quizzes. We also will introduce you to a
sleep education website, MyApnea.org, where you can get more information on
sleep disorders and participate in forums and blogs to learn from other
patients and clinicians about sleep disorders. \\

We hope that your participation will help improve our understanding of sleep
disorders and lead to improved treatments and diagnoses. In addition, if other
Partners research staff have approval from the Partners Ethics Board that
oversees research, they will be able to request access of the data for
additional research projects. These additional research projects may also lead
to improved treatments and diagnoses. \\

% Section 7
\section*{Can I still get medical care within Partners if I don't take part in this research study, or if I stop taking part?}

Yes. Your decision won't change the medical care you get within Partners now
or in the future. There will be no penalty, and you won't lose any benefits
you receive now or have a right to receive. \\

Taking part in this research study is up to you. You can decide not to take
part. If you decide to take part now, you can change your mind and drop out
later. We will tell you if we learn new information that could make you change
your mind about taking part in this research study. \\

% Section 8
\section*{What should I do if I want to stop taking part in the study?}

If you take part in this research study, and want to drop out, you should tell
us. We will make sure that you stop the study safely. We will also talk to you
about follow-up care, if needed. \\

Also, it is possible that we will have to ask you to drop out of the study
before you finish it. If this happens, we will tell you why. We will also help
arrange other care for you, if needed. \\

% Section 9
\section*{Will I be paid to take part in this research study?}

Participants will receive a parking voucher (worth up to \$10) if you are
recruited to join the study while you are at the clinic or sleep laboratory.
When you complete each set of surveys and brain quizzes, you will be entered
into a lottery to receive a \$100 gift card. The lottery is drawn quarterly. \\

% Section 10
\section*{What will I have to pay for if I take part in this research study?}

Study funds will pay for certain study-related items and services. We may bill
your health insurer for, among other things, routine items and services you
would have received even if you did not take part in the research. You will be
responsible for payment of any deductibles and co-payments required by your
insurer for this routine care or other billed care. If you have any questions
about costs to you that may result from taking part in the research, please
speak with the study doctors and study staff. If necessary, we will arrange
for you to speak with someone in Patient Financial Services about these costs. \\

% Section 11
\section*{What happens if I am injured as a result of taking part in this research study?}

We will offer you the care needed to treat any injury that directly results
from taking part in this research study. We reserve the right to bill your
insurance company or other third parties, if appropriate, for the care you get
for the injury. We will try to have these costs paid for, but you may be
responsible for some of them. For example, if the care is billed to your
insurer, you will be responsible for payment of any deductibles and
co-payments required by your insurer. \\

Injuries sometimes happen in research even when no one is at fault. There are
no plans to pay you or give you other compensation for an injury, should one
occur. However, you are not giving up any of your legal rights by signing this
form. \\

If you think you have been injured or have experienced a medical problem as a
result of taking part in this research study, tell the person in charge of
this study as soon as possible. The researcher's name and phone number are
listed in the next section of this consent form. \\

Some people or groups who get your health information might not have to follow
the same privacy rules that we follow and might use or share your health
information without your permission in ways that are not described in this
form. For example, we understand that the sponsor of this study may use your
health information to perform additional research on various products or
conditions, to obtain regulatory approval of its products, to propose new
products, and to oversee and improve its products' performance. We share your
health information only when we must, and we ask anyone who receives it from
us to take measures to protect your privacy. The sponsor has agreed that it
will not contact you without your permission and will not use or share your
information for any mailing or marketing list. However, once your information
is shared outside Partners, we cannot control all the ways that others use or
share it and cannot promise that it will remain private. \\

Because research is an ongoing process, we cannot give you an exact date when
we will either destroy or stop using or sharing your health information. \\

The results of this research study may be published in a medical book or
journal, or used to teach others. However, your name or other identifying
information \textbf{will not} be used for these purposes without your specific
permission. \\

\subsection*{Your Privacy Rights}
