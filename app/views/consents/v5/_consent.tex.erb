Sponsor: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). \\

\section*{What is the purpose of the research?}

The purpose of the SleepINNOVATE study is to learn more about why patients get
sleep disorders, how sleep disorders affect daily life, and how satisfied
patients are with treatment. This study hopes to better understand sleep
disorders to improve care and quality of life better for patients. \\

\section*{Why am I being asked to participate?}

We are asking you to take part in this research study because you have had
a sleep study, are scheduled to have a sleep study, or have a diagnosis of
a sleep disorder. To participate in this study, you need to be 18 or older
and read English. \\

\section*{How many people will participate?}

We hope to enroll at least 2,000 people into the SleepINNOVATE study. \\


\section*{What happens if I decide to participate and how long will it take?}
\subsection*{Health surveys and brain quizzes:}

After you consent to the SleepINNOVATE
study, you will create an ID and password to log into the study website.
On the website, you will be asked to complete surveys and brain quizzes on
our secure web portal.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Health surveys will take less than 30 minutes for most people to
    complete. They will ask questions about demographics, health, general
    functioning, and sleep habits.
  \item
    Brain quizzes may take a total of 20-minutes to complete. The short
    quizzes will test different brain functions like concentration and
    memory. The quizzes are administered by The Many Brains Project
    (testmybrain.org), a non-profit organization that creates testing tools
    for research studies. The Many Brains Project will have access to the
    testing results but no information that could identify you.
\end{itemize}

We will give you feedback on how you did when you finish some of the
surveys and when you finish the brain quizzes. We do not expect there to
be any risks to you from taking the surveys or brain quizzes. For
questions that might make you feel uncomfortable, you have the option to
skip that question or decline to respond. You are also free to end the
survey or brain quiz at any time. \\

We hope to track your progress for at least 2 years. This is very
important to help understand how the health of sleep patients changes
overtime. We will follow-up by email and ask you to complete the surveys
after approximately 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. These
reminder emails will not be encrypted; however, we will never send your
personal information in an email. The reminder emails will be sent to the
email address that you give us. \\


\section*{Will information be gathered from other sources?}
\subsection*{Medical record health information:}

In addition to the surveys and brain quizzes, we are asking for your
permission to access to your health information and save this information
on a secure research database:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Sleep study data: summary sleep reports, the waveforms collected on the
    sleep study, CPAP adherence data (if you have had a sleep study or use
    CPAP type devices).
  \item
    Partners Health electronic medical records: extract information on your
    health conditions, treatments, health behaviors, hospitalizations,
    procedures, and laboratory results.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Partners Biobank:}

If you have not already enrolled or declined to enroll, we will also
invite you to enroll in the Partners Biobank. If you wish to participate,
we will review a separate consent form with you. \\

\section*{How will sensitive information be handled and kept confidential and secure?}

For your security, "identifying information" such as name and date of
birth, will be removed from your information and then deposited in a
research repository that will be accessed by other researchers.
Information collected about you will be combined with the information of
other people in the research study. Results will always report aggregate
trends and never include personal information, like your name, without
your specific permission. \\

The following parties may see, use, and share your identifiable health
information:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Partners research staff involved in this study
  \item
    The sponsor(s) of this study, and the people or groups it hires to help
    perform this research
  \item
    Other researchers and medical centers that are part of this study and
    their ethics boards
  \item
    A group that oversees the data (study information) and safety of this
    research
  \item
    Non-research staff within Partners who need this information to do their
    jobs (such as for treatment, payment (billing), or health care
    operations)
  \item
    The Partners ethics board that oversees the research and the Partners
    research quality improvement programs.
  \item
    People from organizations that provide independent accreditation and
    oversight of hospitals and research
  \item
    People or groups that we hire to do work for us, such as data storage
    companies, insurers, and lawyers
  \item
    Federal and state agencies (such as the Food and Drug Administration,
    the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of
    Health, and other US or foreign government bodies that oversee or review
    research)
  \item
    Public health and safety authorities (for example, if we learn
    information that could mean harm to you or others, we may need to report
    this, as required by law)
\end{itemize}

Some people or groups who get your health information might not have to
follow the same privacy rules that we follow and might use or share your
health information without your permission in ways that are not described
in this form. For example, we understand that the sponsor of this study
may use your health information to perform additional research on various
products or conditions, to obtain regulatory approval of its products, to
propose new products, and to oversee and improve its products'
performance. We share your health information only when we must, and we
ask anyone who receives it from us to take measures to protect your
privacy. The sponsor has agreed that it will not contact you without your
permission and will not use or share your information for any mailing or
marketing list. However, once your information is shared outside Partners,
we cannot control all the ways that others use or share it and cannot
promise that it will remain private. \\

Because research is an ongoing process, we cannot give you an exact date
when we will either destroy or stop using or sharing your health
information. \\

We are required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA) to protect the privacy of health information obtained for
research. This is an abbreviated notice and does not describe all details
of this requirement (see Partners Privacy Notice*).
During this study, identifiable information about you or your health will
be collected and shared with the researchers conducting the research. In
general, under federal law, identifiable health information is private.
However, there are exceptions to this rule. In some cases, others may see
your identifiable health information for purposes of research oversight,
quality control, public health and safety, or law enforcement. We share
your health information only when we must, and we ask anyone who receives
it from us to protect your privacy. \\

\subsection*{Your Privacy Rights}

You have the right not to sign this form that allows us to use and share
your health information for research; however, if you don't sign it, you
can't take part in this research study. \\

You have the right to withdraw your permission for us to use or share your
health information for this research study. If you want to withdraw your
permission, you must notify the person in charge of this research study in
writing. Once permission is withdrawn, you cannot continue to take part in
the study. \\

If you withdraw your permission, we will not be able to take back
information that has already been used or shared with others. \\

You have the right to see and get a copy of your health information that
is used or shared for treatment or for payment. To ask for this
information, please contact the person in charge of this research study.
You may only get such information after the research is finished. \\

\section*{What is the risk of a breach of confidentiality?}

Although we will do our best to protect your study information, there is
still a very small risk of loss of privacy. All study staff will be
trained and certified in the ethical conduct of human subject research and
how to keep all study information strictly confidential. \\

\section*{What are the benefits of participating?}

We will introduce you to a sleep education website, MyApnea.Org. You can
get more information on sleep disorders from the blog articles and learn
from other patients and clinicians on the forum. We hope that your
participation will help improve our understanding of sleep disorders and
lead to improved treatments and diagnoses. \\

\section*{Will I be paid for participating?}

If you are recruited to join the study while you are at the clinic or
sleep laboratory, you will receive a parking voucher (worth up to \$10).
When you complete each set of surveys and brain quizzes, you will be
entered into a lottery to receive a \$50 gift card. The lottery is drawn
twice every 3 months. If you win, you will receive the gift card through
email. \\

\section*{Is participation voluntary?}

Participation is voluntary, and you can stop at any time. If you decide to
drop out, please contact us to tell us. We may talk to you about follow-up
care, if needed. \\

It is possible that you will be asked to drop out of the study before you
finish it. If this happens, we will tell you why. \\

\section*{Can I still get medical care within Partners if I don't take part in this research study, or if I stop taking part?}

Deciding not to participate won't affect medical care you receive at
Partners now or in the future, or any benefits you receive now or have a
right to receive. \\
